      <h2>Finding Problems:</h2>
      <p>
        To discover problems with the current website, I decided to use
        the four usability guidelines: usability, learnability, memorability,
        and efficiency.
      </p>
      <h3>Usability:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The restaurant name is overlaid on a background image, which
          makes the restaurant name hard to read.
        </li>
        <li>Line breaks cause important information to be misleading. On the
          left menu, "Local Delivery" seems to be a link and "Hours" seems
          to list the normal operation hours. However, that is actually one
          entire text field called "Local Delivery Hours", and the store
          actually has completely different operating hours.
        </li>
        <li>The small navbar text makes it hard to find and read.</li>
        <li>The website is not responsive, which also makes reading the
          website on smaller screens very difficult.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Learnability:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The navbar is duplicated at bottom of the website for no reason,
          which is confusing.
        </li>
        <li>Some underlined text fields are not links, while others are links.</li>
        <li>Despite using the same blue color as a traditional link, 
          the "7am-2pm" text is not actually a link.
        </li>
        <li>You can order food from this website, but this option is hidden
          deep in another page.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Memorability:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The website has a very old fashioned design, which does not 
          lead to it being memorable.
        </li>
        <li>The numerous spelling and grammar mistakes make the website
          memorable in a negative way.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Efficiency:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>An important fact, "Open to the Public," is not immediately obvious
          to a reader since it is hidden in the left menu.
        </li>
        <li>The scan order is confusing. If you start reading from the
          left menu, you need to move your eyes both to the right and down
          in order to start reading the main content of the page.
        </li>
        <li>On large screens, all of the content is aligned to the left,
          which leaves massive amounts of whitespace only on the right and
          requires you to only look at the left of your screen.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

        <h2>Accessibility:</h2>
        <p>
          As society becomes more and more intertwined with technology, it is important
          to remember that not everyone has the same abilities as other people. We
          should always design our interfaces with accessibility in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the accessibility of the original website leaves much
          to be desired. Using the WebAIM WAVE accessibility tool, I discovered
          4 errors, 12 contrast errors, and 20 alerts. Some of the errors include
          missing alt text for images, empty headings, and a missing page title.
          Some alerts include instances of very small text and no defined page
          regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using a screen-reader on the original website was also not a good experience.
          The spelling errors and extra punctuation confused the screen-reader and
          resulted in weird pronunciations. Furthermore, some of the menu information
          on the left of the screen required multiple clicks to read, which was
          an extra annoyance. Suffice it to say, the original website was not
          designed with accessibility in mind.
        </p>

    <div class="container pt-3 pb-3">
      <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframes:</h2>
      <p>
        The first step towards an interface redesign is creating "lo-fi"
        wireframes. These wireframs are good for visualizing an application's
        general layout. We further annotate our wireframes to demonstrate how
        our redesign fixes the issues we found above.
      </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg">

        </div>
        <div class="row mt-3 mb-3">
          <div class=col-lg>
            <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">1. We make the navbar the first item
                on the page, make the text inside the navbar larger, and also
                remove the duplicate navbar at the bottom of the page. By doing
                this, we the navbar issues we listed above, since now the
                navbar is easy to find due to its increased size. 
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">2. The restaurant name is now
                text and does not have an image background. This makes the
                restaurant name easy to read and removes the contrast issue.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">3. We make "Now Open to the Public!"
                front and center. This means this vital information is much
                harder to miss, since your eyes must scan past this line to reach
                the rest of the content.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">4. This annotation is meant to
                demonstrate multiple fixes. First, we fix all the miscellaneous small
                issues we listed above, such as bad spelling/grammer, misleading
                text color, and misleading text underlines. Furthermore, we change
                the scan pattern to a more intuitive top to bottom order. These
                combined changes make the site much easier to navigate.
              </li>

            <ul class="list-group mt-3 mb-3">
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">5. We make the order functionality
                of the website obvious by including an order button in the
                middle of the website. This means that users will now easily
                be able to find how to order food and won't need to dig
                through different pages on the site.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">6. We fix the clarity issue
                regarding the listed hours here. Now, it is obvious that
                "Hours" and "Local Delivery Hours" are distinct, and that
                the times listed are simply text and are not links.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-light">7. We distribute whitespace
                evenly on larger screens. This prevents users from needing to
                stare at a corner of their screen when trying to use the website,
                which was a problem we identified earlier.

                responsive portions of the redesigned websites. This includes
                features such as a collapsible menu bar, images and text that
                automatically resize, and columns that become stacked as 
                screen space is decreased. The combination of these features
                lead to a design that is responsive across many different
                devices. Furthermore, we still follow the patterns we established
                earlier in the desktop redesign.

        <h2>High-Fidelity Prototypes:</h2>
        <p>
          The next step in the design process is creating "hi-fi" prototypes.
          These prototypes should be based on the layouts established in the
          lo-fi wireframes, and would ideally look exactly like the final product.
          We annotate our prototypes to explain how to handle responsive changes.

                <li class="list-group-item">1. This navbar will be
                  implemented using a flex-box with content justified using flex-end.
                  This will allow the elements to be aligned to the right hand side.
                  The current page will have a dark gray colored link. Other links
                  have a lighter gray color, and links that are hovered over will
                  have a medium shade of gray. For specific colors, reference
                  the style guide. These transitions can be implemented using
                  CSS media queries.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">2. Images will have max-width
                  set to 100% and height set to auto, which allows for images
                  that are responsive and automatically resize as needed.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">3. All site content is wrapped
                  in a div that uses media queries with standard breakpoints to adjust
                  the width of the div. This div is centered so that if a large screen
                  is used, there will be whitespace on both the left and right of the image,
                  and all important content will be in the center.

                  also be adjusted using CSS media queries and standard device
                  breakpoints. This ensures that text on our website will also
                  be responsive.

                  interactive states. When the button is hovered over, the button
                  should darken in color. When the button is clicked, it should both
                  darken and receive an outline. All of this can be done using
                  different CSS media queries such as :hover and :focus. For
                  specific color information, reference the style guide below.

                  show that the tables can be read even on a mobile device.

                  media queries. The logic to show and hide navbar links requires a combination 
                  of CSS as well as some JavaScript. The navbar links themselves should appear

        <p>
          The two main goals of my redesign were to first make the website
          more responsive to different screen sizes, and to also fix the accessibility
          issues present in the original site.
        </p>
        <p>
          After some experimenting with different screen sizes, the redesigned
          website is defintely responsive. Images and text are resized as needed to
          fit on the screen, and columns are even collapsed as the screen gets smaller.

          Accessibility is also much better. Besides WebAIM WAVE reporting no
          errors, using a screen-reader to navigate the site is much easier as
          there are no more grammer or spelling mistakes. Furthermore, the simplier
          layout of the website also makes navigating the site using a screen-reader
          much easier.

      <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
      <p>
        As someone who has relatively little UI/UX experience, I think going
        through the full process of redesigning an existing website was an
        enlightening experience. I defintely learned a lot while going
        through this complex process. And, I think I am pretty satisfied with
        the end result. While I'm sure this redesign won't win any awards,
        I am still satisfied at my first attempt at a redesign.
